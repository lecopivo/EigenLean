* Eigen ↔ Lean interface

  Proof of concept for interfacing Eigen's linear solvers in Lean 4.

  To compile:
  #+begin_src lean
    lake script run compileCpp
    lake build
  #+end_src

  Example code of solving simple 2x2 system with LDLT:
  #+begin_src lean
    def main : IO Unit := do
      let A : Matrix 2 2 := ⟨FloatArray.mk #[2,1,1,2], by native_decide⟩
      let b : Matrix 2 1 := ⟨FloatArray.mk #[1,1], by native_decide⟩
      IO.println A
      IO.println b
      IO.println (A.ldlt.solve b)
  #+end_src
  To run the example =./build/bin/EigenLean=.
